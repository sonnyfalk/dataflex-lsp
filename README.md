# DataFlex-LSP
Language server for the DataFlex programming language.

## Building
The LSP server can be built together with the VSCode extension, or it can be built standalone. The recommended way is to build it together with editor extensions via the `dataflex-lsp-workspace`, which also builds the VSCode extension.

## Build with dataflex-lsp-workspace
See instructions in [dataflex-lsp-workspace](https://github.com/sonnyfalk/dataflex-lsp-workspace).
